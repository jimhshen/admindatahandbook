## Archiving

We will use the generic J-PAL archiving. The following entities should be managed:

| HTML version of the whole handbook | ZIP file of entire handbook               |
| HTML pages of each chapter         | Single HTML file                          |
| PDF of the whole book              | PDF                                       |
| PDF of individual chapters (if produced) | PDF                                 |
| Ebook  (Kindle version)            | Mobi file                                 |
| Ebook  (EPUB version)              | EPUB file                                 |

In each case, the DOI will be pointed at the URL.
