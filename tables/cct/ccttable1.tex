Technical solutions & - Finding a data sharing platform with sufficient metadata and access control capabilities to support researcher-specific use restrictions\\
                    & - Integrating said platform with CCT data systems\\
Data infrastructure & - Development of metadata standards\\
                    & - Assessment of self-hosting options versus cloud computing with the appropriate attention given to security concerns.\\
IT architecture 	& - Addressing tensions between existing and newer approaches and technology stacks\\
                    & - Ensuring that legacy systems do not create barriers to effective data sharing\\
Governance 	        & - Process improvement evaluations\\
                    & - Processes for integrating data use agreements with the data sharing platform\\
Data privacy        & The evolution of CCT's understanding and application of applicable data laws and data ethics considerations must keep pace with CCT's increasingly open data environment\\
