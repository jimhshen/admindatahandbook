Shawn is a Co-Chair of J-PAL's Innovations in Data and Experiments for Action Initiative (IDEA). His research examines agriculture, corporate finance, banking, and consumer finance in developing countries. He has conducted randomized evaluations in education, financial literacy, agricultural risk management, and ICT for agriculture. He received a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005, where he was an NSF and Javits Fellow, and an A.B. in Economics and German Literature from Cornell University.

He works with the Board of Directors to develop J-PAL’s strategic vision, with leadership of the seven regional offices to coordinate J-PAL’s worldwide research, policy outreach, capacity building, and operations, and with funding partners to secure resources for J-PAL worldwide. He has setup many partnerships for J-PAL with data providers and implementing partners. He is a co-PI on a very large randomized evaluation in India that used both survey data and large admin datasets to help a state government reduce health care absenteeism. Iqbal has a deep appreciation of the concerns and constraints of data providers in governments as he began his career as a member of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) formulating policy and implementing programs across many assignments. Later as a Director in an economic consulting firm in Chicago, he analyzed numerous very large data sets to provide critical insights to private sector clients in manufacturing, health, banking and automotive sectors.
