\toprule
& 2020 Decennial Census & The Opportunity Atlas & Dataverse repositories\\
\midrule
Risks \& Sensitivity & \textbf{Sensitivity:} Data subject to stringent statutory protections. Trust in confidentiality critical to collecting sensitive information from respondents.\newline
\textbf{Risks:} Concerns about composition effects and reconstruction attacks motivated adoption of DP. &
\textbf{Sensitivity:} Data subject to stringent statutory protections.\newline
\textbf{Risks:} Prior methods of de-identification and redaction judged not to sufficiently mitigate risk. &
\textbf{Sensitivity:} General-purpose system designed to support analyses of data of varying degrees of sensitivity.\newline
\textbf{Risks:} Vary by data source. DP provides stronger mechanism to mitigate risk than pre-deposit redaction and deidenfication. \\

\midrule
Tiered Access Controls &
Part of a tiered access system that has historically included custom tabulations service for institutional clients; and Research Data Centers for access by vetted individuals to private data. &
Original data sources remain available to vetted users through federal Restricted Data Center mechanism. &
 Part of a tiered access model that also supports access to private data with vetting and restricted license. \\
\midrule
Trust \& Publication Models &
Curator model, based on prior data collection design, with cleaning before DP applied. Focus on non-interactive publication of tables. &
Curator model applied to previously collected data, with cleaning and linkage (between Census and IRS data) before DP-like methods applied. &
Curator model, based on previously collected and deposited data. Supports both non-interactive releases of summary statistics and interactive queries. \\
\midrule
Budget Allocation &
Must allocate budget and optimize accuracy for broad range of current and  future  analyses. &
Budget analysis focused on balancing privacy vs. societal utility, leading to choice of a rather large epsilon. &
Provides recommended choices of epsilon based on sensitivity of data. Choice to allow per-analyst budgets requires semi-trusted and accountable analysts.\\
\midrule
Estimating Uncertainty &
Adopting DP has made noise addition explicit, whereas data users had previously treated Census tables as if they have no error. &
Designed to produce uncertainty estimates (taking privacy noise into account) together with quantities of interest, and estimates also calculated in a DP-like manner. &
Important to expose uncertainty estimates from noise due to privacy, both before and after release.\\
\midrule
Granularity &
Focused both on individuals and households, as appropriate to data measurement design &
Focused on individuals. &
Determined by data depositor.\\
