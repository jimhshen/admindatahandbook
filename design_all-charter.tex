The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) is a global research
center working to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is informed by
scientific evidence. Anchored by a network of more than 225 affiliated
professors at universities around the world, J-PAL draws on results from
randomized impact evaluations to answer critical questions in the fight
against poverty. We build partnerships with governments, NGOs, donors,
and others to share this knowledge, scale up effective programs, and
advance evidence-informed decision-making. J-PAL was launched at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2003 and has regional centers
in Africa, Europe, Latin America \& the Caribbean, the Middle East \&
North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

\section{The Potential of Administrative Data for Research and Policymaking}

Over the course of our careers, we, the editors of this Handbook, have been witness to extraordinary changes in economics and economic research. One of them has been the rise of research in applied microeconomics and development economics that focuses on working closely with policymaking bodies and creating an evidence base for better social programming. Two key factors have contributed to this trend: increased availability of new data sources, and the rapid growth in the use of experiments (randomized control trials or randomized evaluations) in the social sciences. These developments have enabled many new avenues of research, such as how behavioral factors affect optimal policy design, how to credibly evaluate long-run effects of landmark social programs, or how to make changes to these programs informed by a better understanding of the levers of impact. In the process, they have dramatically improved the quality and breadth of evidence used to inform policy.

Yet it is also our experience that this type of research is in many cases conducted by carrying out complex, time-consuming, and costly original data collection: for example, the large-scale surveys that accompany many randomized control trials typically consume a large share of the financial and staff resources devoted to the research project overall. A lack of relevant, reliable, and comprehensive data that researchers can access has been a limiting factor for new studies and consequently the spread of evidence-informed policy.

At the same time, there are a wide variety of data sets already in existence, such as census records, banking data, employment information, or GPS records, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of policy-relevant research – including randomized control trials – and speed up the formation of an evidence base for policymaking. Administrative data, sometimes referred to as organic data (Groves 2011) because they are generated as part of normal business processes, often contain comprehensive, objective data about large populations of interest. Decision-makers at firms and in government are already using such data to better understand problems and issues of populations of interest, and based on such evidence-based analytics, new policies are implemented or new questions are defined.

\end{figure}

Beyond these uses, carefully designed systematic research with administrative data, often partnering academic researchers with firms and governments, may carry out analyses, conduct experiments, and develop and field supplemental surveys to test specific mechanisms or hypotheses. This type of innovative research could dramatically expand the types of insights gained from the data. An increasing fraction of published papers in economics uses administrative data (see Figure 1.1, Chetty (2012)). However, researcher access to administrative data sets remains difficult and idiosyncratic (Card et al. 2010). This Handbook is motivated by our view that easier access and an increased use of administrative data sets by researchers could dramatically improve the quantity and quality of available evidence on social programs and policies.
