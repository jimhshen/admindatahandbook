## Appendix {-}

The following are excerpts from Sub-Award or Non-Disclosure Agreements

### Public Use Data Set {-}

The following clause was included in the sub-award agreement between Aurora Health Care (the Sub-awardee) and MIT permitting the publication of a data set upon completion of the study

"Notwithstanding the foregoing, a subset of the Subawardee Confidential Information will be made public according to the terms set forth in this section ("Public Data Set") and will not be treated as Subawardee Confidential Information once made public. The Public Data Set will not include patient, encounter, and financial level data elements. It will only include provider level data elements and may include aggregate patient and financial information. The exact nature of the Public Data Set will be determined at the end of the Research as it may depend on the findings. The Public Data Set is anticipated to be a provider-level data set with physician characteristics including provider type (MD, DO, NP, PA), specialty, age bins and average patient characteristics, along with outcomes including the number of scans that would trigger the best practice alert (BPA) being evaluated in this Research, the number of high cost scan orders, the number of scan orders with a score of 1-3, the number of scans with a score of 4-6 and the number of low cost scans. The outcomes will be measured over various timeframes such as 0-1 month, 0-3 months, 0-6 months, 0-9 months, and 0-12 months. The Public Data Set may be made available on the OSF and DataVerse websites and may be available to the public indefinitely. The exact list of data elements and aggregate data to be made public will be agreed upon by both Parties in year 3 of the Research and prior to the Public Data Set being made public."

### Publishing {-}

The following is from the sub-award agreement:

"If and to the extent that each Party has contributed to the results of the Research, the two Parties may work together in good faith to publish the results jointly, as appropriate. The foregoing notwithstanding, both MIT and Subawardee shall have the right to publish the results of the Research arising from such portion of the Research performed solely by such Party, along with any background information about the Research that is necessary to be included in any publication of results or necessary for other scholars to verify such results. Prior to publication of Research performed solely by one Party, the publishing Party must provide the other Party with at least thirty (30) calendar days advance notice for the non-publishing Party to review the manuscript in order to identify patentable subject matter or the inadvertent disclosure of Subawardee Confidential Information."

The following is from the NDA:

"Aurora acknowledges that MIT is receiving Confidential Information in anticipation of its faculty preparing written scholarly work ("Scholarly Work"). In the event MIT personnel seek to publish a Scholarly Work, Aurora will have a thirty (30) day period to review the Scholarly Work for any disclosure of Confidential Information. Aurora shall, within the thirty (30) day period, give MIT notice identifying specifically any Confidential Information it believes would be disclosed in the Scholarly Work. If Aurora does not provide timely notice, it will be deemed to have waived any objection to disclosure of Confidential Information."
